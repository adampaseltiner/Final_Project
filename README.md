# Final Project

## Project Proposal

For the final project, the team has decided to perform an analysis of housing prices for the DMV area over the last five years. The team wants to see if any trends can be detected in the data that might have been interrrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, have more homes been purchased in 2020 than the average for the previous four years, have neighborhood demographics changed during the studied time period, and have home prices in 2020 gone up disproportionately to the other years in the study. The team also wants to use a supervised machine learning model to see if the data can be used to predict future home prices in the region.

## Technology Overview

The team intends to use the Pandas library for cleaning and scraping the data, PostgreSQL to store and complile the dataset to be analyzed, and the scikitlearn library for compiling the machine learning model. Additionally, all visuals for the final deliverable will be created using Tableau.

All data used for the segment 1 deliverables came from a precleaned and compiled dataset pulled from kaggle.com in order to mockup the databases and machine learning model we intend to use for the final project deliverable. The team intends to build a similar dataset with data relating to the DMV region and five year time period we are analyzing using webscraping and APIs from zillow.com and Census data for demographic information.

## Communication Protocol

The team is communicating primarily through twice weekly two hour planning sessions as well as a private Slack channel. When necessary, the team also meets on Google MeetUp to track progress, plan next steps, and work through any issues.
